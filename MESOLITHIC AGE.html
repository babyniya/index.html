Mesolithic Age
</h2>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center">
The transition from Old Stone Age to the New Stone Age is known as<br>the Mesolithic period, there were changes in climatic conditions. Animals in particular,<br> became smaller in size. This small size enabled the animals<br> to move faster. Because of this, man had to develop<br>lighter tools to aid them in hunting. Hunting and gathering plants<br> continued to be the main source of food<br>until they began to store food in storages for later consumption. Archaeological<br> findings and wall paintings proved that domestication of animals,<br> specifically dogs, was the main development of this period.<br>
