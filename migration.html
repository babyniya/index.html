The Early Human Migration
</h2>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center">
The early transition from hunting and gathering to farming
<br>
and herding took place in many places. This proved that early<br>
humans had migrated in many parts of the world. As the<br>
migration map show, humans struggled to move into West Asia,<br>North Asia, and Central Asia thousands of years ago. They travelled<br>
Through East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

Jarmo in West Asia (presently Iraq) and Catal Huyuk (presently in<br>Turkey) were good examples of the early village settlements. Jericho was the oldest city<br>
ever discovered. Since 1989, a team led by Ufuk Esin<br>
of Istanbul University has been excavating Asikli.<br>
Asikli is a village believed to be about 1000 years<br>older than Catal Huyuk.

It was British archaeologist James Mellaart who discovered <br> Catal Huyuk  in 1958. According to Mellaart, the site <br>is 4500 years older than the pyramids of Egypt. On<br>
the other hand, the excavation of Jericho was first carried out by<br>British archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon in the 1950s.

Catal Huyuk is a Neolithic town located in South Central Turkey.<br>
As described, the city layout does not show traces of streets,<br>
but it shows very evident structures of brick houses which<br>
which are positioned alongside each other. The passage into<br>
the houses is through an opening on the roof.<br>
Located between two volcanoes, the village was known for<br>its abundant obsidian products and dark volcanic rock<br>used to make mirrors, jewelries, and knives.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
The excavation of Catal Huyuk also revealed illustrated<br>
wall paintings of animals and hunting scenes. The painting also<br>showed erupting volcano and hunters slaying wild<br>
cattles and other wild animals. Artifacts like stone beads,<br>grinding equipment, native copper, lead beads<br>
and ground obsidian mirrors were founf at the site. An<br> artifact is an object produced or shaped by human skill,<br>such as a tool, weapon, or ornament of archaeological<br>or historical interest.
