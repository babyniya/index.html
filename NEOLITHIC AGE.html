The Neolithic Revolution
</h2>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center">
The second phase of the Stone Age is known as the New Stone Age or<br>
Neolithic Age. This began 10,000 years ago. At this time, man made<br>
more polished stone tools.<br>They also made potteries and started<br>
to cultivate crops<br>

In the event of the growth of population, it was believed that <br>
agricultural revolution also occured. Scientists concluded that<br>
this might have caused by the change in climate. Rising temperatures<br>
worldwide provided longer growing seasons. With the continuous growth<br>
of population, man was forced to find ways to supply their needs.<br> 
Thus, it was believed that they continuosly attempted to farm.<br>Farming provided a steady source of food.<br>
During the Neolithic Age:<br>
-Man learned to polish his tools to a fine edge and sharp<br>points.<br>
-Man discovered the importance of settling down in<br>villages, domesticating animals, and planting their own food. Due to the uncertainty<br>of food supply in the Paleolithic Age, agriculture became the greatest<br>
discovery of man. Agricultural productivity led to a production boom.<br>
-Man settled in permanent homes. As man learned agriculture, he also learned<br>to live in permnent places such as villages and started to build shelters. This probably<br>became the reason for the intentiveness and creativity of man.  They started to build furniture,<br>
make potteries, and weave clothing. More people lived together and formed<br>communities. This led to the creation of rules and laws to act as social control.<br>
This also created the first organized governments.<br>
-Man began to develop shared ways of doing things as they began<br>to live near one another. This is caled culture.
Culture refers to the way of life of a group of people<br> in a certain place.<br>It is the sum of total of the learned behaviour of a group that are generally considered to be<br>the tradition of those people<br> and are transmitted from generation to generation.
